# STYTCH X nxyz

This is a collaboration to show an example of what Stytch's Web3 auth and nxyz's blockchain data API can do.

The example is a wallet viewer app that authenticates with [Stytch's](https://stytch.com/docs/sdks/javascript-sdk#crypto-wallets_ui-components) web3 login SDK then displays the the most recent nfts bought and trasactions don on the wallet using the data from the nxyz wallet endpoint.

Some things to notice about the demo:
- ‚õì The data is from the most recent block of the Ethereum blockchain
- ‚ö°Ô∏è It takes less than 1/2 second to retrieve all of the wallet data
- üì¶ Much more data is receiving than what is displayed in the demo

nxyz is a startup making reading blockchains as easy as a api call and as fast as search.
you can learn more about nxyz at our website n.xyz or in our [api documentation](https://docs.n.xyz/).

We made this in next.js with Vercel so you can try out the Demo here:
https://stytch-x-nxyz.vercel.app/

## Prerequisites 

To Run this demo locally you need 2 things:
- a stytch public api token
- a nxyz api key

### setup Stytch
After signing up for Stytch, you'll need a public_token. You can find these in the [API keys tab](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys).

put this value in the .env.template file for the Stytch key. Example:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN="public-token-test-3333333-3333-3333-3333-3333333333"
```

### get nxyz api key
click this link and copy the demo key into your .env.template file for the nxyz key and
use the proper host for the api calls you make per the [docs](https://docs.n.xyz/).
https://share.1password.com/s#PE8aY4siBHZo5-fOyCk8obxbewXx5DwuxI2vsAw18Xg
Example:
```
NXYZ_API_KEY="nsihcusd79s8hcd8hidjc"
NXYZ_API_HOST="https://api.n.xyz" // most common host
```

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new .env.local file. Example:
```bash
cp .env.template .env.local
# Replace your keys in new .env.local file`
```

## How to run your own copy on Vercel
use this link + a stytch public api token + a nxyz api key 
to fork the github repo and have a vercel site made for it.

once the site is deployed you will want to [add the api keys to vercel using their website GUI](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#development-environment-variables).

## How to run locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the demo.
