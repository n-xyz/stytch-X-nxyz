# STYTCH √ó nxyz

This collaboration demonstrates the combined ease and power of [Stytch's](https://stytch.com/) Web3 auth platform and [nxyz's](https://n.xyz/) blockchain data API.

This wallet viewer app authenticates a user with [Stytch's web3 login SDK](https://stytch.com/docs/sdks/javascript-sdk#crypto-wallets_ui-components) and displays the user's Ethereum wallet. It leverages nxyz's wallet API to show the wallet's most recent NFTs and transactions.

Some things to notice about the demo:

- ‚õì The data is from the Ethereum blockchain
- ‚ö°Ô∏è The API is blazing fast: it only takes a few hundred milliseconds to retrieve wallet data
- üì¶ The API provides more data that the demo is displaying

nxyz helps developers ship faster for the first billion web3 users. Our multi-chain API turns reading blockchains into real-time performant data streams for any engineer. Retrieve detailed data across wallets, transactions, NFTs, and smart contracts with both on and off-chain information.
You can learn more about nxyz at our website [n.xyz](https://n.xyz/) or in our [API documentation](https://docs.n.xyz/).

This demo was made in Next.js with Vercel. You can try out the demo at [https://stytch-x-nxyz.vercel.app/](stytch-x-nxyz.vercel.app).

## Prerequisites

To run this demo locally you need:

- a Stytch public API token
- a nxyz API key

### Setup Stytch

After signing up for Stytch, you'll need a `public_token`. You can find these in the [API keys tab](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys).

Put this value in the `.env.template` file for the Stytch key. Example:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN="public-token-test-3333333-3333-3333-3333-3333333333"
```

### Get nxyz api key

Copy the demo key into your `.env.template` file for the nxyz key. Example:

```
NXYZ_API_KEY="nhxBst3rzxfu65N3ZvCJssfR"
```

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new .env.local file. Example:

```bash
cp .env.template .env.local
# Replace your keys in the new .env.local file`
```

## How to run your own copy on Vercel

Use this link + a Stytch public API token + a nxyz API key
to fork the GitHub repo and have a Vercel site made for it.

Once the site is deployed you will want to [add the api keys to vercel using their website GUI](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#development-environment-variables).

## How to run locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
